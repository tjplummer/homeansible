# Notes

## Overall
This took me closer to **5 hours**. I lost time setting some things up on a new server at my home.
Also, three year olds make it hard to totally focus at times. Lol.

## Current State
I've used this playbook/config twice. Confirmed to work with the following:
* Debian 11
* DietPi

## Issues
* It's **pretty** barebones. 
* Provisioned access to reach these servers is very lax on my end.
* Wasn't able to really test alerting. Also could only test email, would be nice to ingest with Splunk or something

## Takeaways
I have much more experience with Puppet, but I think Ansible is easier to read and maintain.
